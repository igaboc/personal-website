# Personal Website Portfolio [https://isabellegaboc.netlify.com/]

The aim of this project was to create a personal website, that provides information about who I am, my skills, my resume, and how to contact me. Using the appropriate coding languages learnt (so far) from my intensive course (HTML and CSS), I have been able to create a website that will showcase the MVP for this project.

## The Minimum Viable Product

* Tasteful responsive website viewable on small, and medium/desktop devices
* Contain information about me, my skills, my projects and how to contact me
* Functional links to access my resume, and how to connect with me
* Create a 'contact me' form that will send me an email notification when a user has submitted this form
* An appropriate UX design that will enable professionals to intuitively navigate through the website

## The [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/cdYkMjv29QFiNMlfpAi1i8U0/Personal-Website-Design)

Two things that I focused on my website:
1. A clean design that highlighted sections/information that I wanted to communicate to the audience
2. Chosen style/theme that complimented my personality

### Content First Approach
Initially I went straight to Pinterest to get ideas and pin items onto my moodboard. I took anything that I saw on other people's websites, and began pinning them onto my board (i.e. geometric shapes, lines, artistic images, fashion items). However, after taking a step back and reviewed my moodboard, I found that the items did not match my personality. So I took a different approach, and started working on the content. By focusing on the content, this reiterated the purpose behind the website (i.e. showcase my work) and who the audience was (which was potential hiring managers, recruiters, and fellow developers), and wanted to ensure that the design complimented the content and not the other way around.


### The Influences / The Inspiration / The Moodboard

#### Boxpark Website
Place in East London I loved to hang out when I was living there. Their website and fonts used had the influence onto the color scheme and typography on my personal website.

#### Other Personal Websites

I liked Spatzek's use of lime green contrast against the black and white background and trialled this look on my website. In the end I wasn't a fan of this on my website and chose a design without a bright color contrast.

#### Music
I was listening to a lot of the old school hip hop playlist on Spotify. 

Here's a sample of the album art that appeared on this play list...

... and the contrast likely did influence my decisions on the color palette and wanting to use

#### My Moodboard
Link to my Pinterest moodboard below. The top half of the pins on this moodboard were the influences to the final piece. The bottom half of pins were the initial pins that were placed onto the moodboard prior to creating the content for my website.

### Color Palette

Four color palettes created during the design process. General theme was black, white and grays with a splash of color. Similar to Daniel Spatzek's.

TODO: Discuss reasons why you had chose the final design and UI/UX decisions made

## The Code

TODO: Discuss HTML and CSS. The software used Issues encountered: 
* form submission and use of email client
* nav bar - choice to remove the fixed due to other elements in page over laying on nav bar

## Testing and User Feedback
TODO: Discuss how you tested this in the desktop browser, and mobile after deploying on Netlify. And sent it over to people to review and provide feedback - how someone spotted a typo and how you fixed it

## The Final Product
TODO: Discuss final product and any changes you may make in the future after you have learnt other supported languages
