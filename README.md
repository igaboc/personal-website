# Personal Website Portfolio [https://isabellegaboc.netlify.com/]

The aim of this project was to create a personal website, that provides information about who I am, my skills, my resume, and how to contact me. Using the appropriate coding languages learnt (so far) from my intensive course (HTML and CSS), I have been able to create a website that will showcase the MVP for this project.

## The Minimum Viable Product

* Tasteful responsive website viewable on small, and medium/desktop devices
* Contain information about me, my skills, my projects and how to contact me
* Functional links to access my resume, and how to connect with me
* Create a 'contact me' form that will send me an email notification when a user has submitted this form
* An appropriate UX design that will enable professionals to intuitively navigate through the website

## The [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/cdYkMjv29QFiNMlfpAi1i8U0/Personal-Website-Design)

Two things that I focused on my website:
1. A clean design that highlighted sections/information that I wanted to communicate to the audience
2. Chosen style/theme that complimented my personality

### Content First Approach
Initially I went straight to Pinterest to get ideas and pin items onto my moodboard. I took anything that I saw on other people's websites, and began pinning them onto my board (i.e. geometric shapes, lines, artistic images, fashion items). However, after taking a step back and reviewed my moodboard, I found that the items did not match my personality. So I took a different approach, and started working on the content. By focusing on the content, this reiterated the purpose behind the website (i.e. showcase my work) and who the audience was (which was potential hiring managers, recruiters, and fellow developers), and wanted to ensure that the design complimented the content and not the other way around.


### The Influences / The Inspiration / The Moodboard

#### Chin Chin - The Book
This book was sitting on my kitchen table as I was doing research at home. I liked the fonts and black and white contrast seen in this book and on their menu.

#### Boxpark Website
Place in East London I loved to hang out when I was living there. Their website and fonts used had the influence onto the color scheme and typography on my personal website.

#### Other Personal Websites

I liked Spatzek's use of lime green contrast against the black and white background and trialled this look on my website. In the end I wasn't a fan of this on my website and chose a design without a bright color contrast.

#### Music
I was listening to a lot of the old school hip hop playlist on Spotify. 

Here's a sample of the album art that appeared on this play list...

... and used this style to create a logo which can be seen in my figma board. I didn't end up using this because this style looked to similar to the rest of my page.

#### My Moodboard
Link to my Pinterest moodboard below. The top half of the pins on this moodboard were the influences to the final piece. The bottom half of pins were the initial pins that were placed onto the moodboard prior to creating the content for my website.

### Color Palette

Four color palettes created during the design process. General theme was black, white and grays with a splash of color. Similar to Daniel Spatzek's.

### Typography
Logo: [Special Elite](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Special+Elite)

Main Headings: [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans) - Originally this was meant to be 'Mina', a font I used in figma, unfortunately this was not available in Google fonts, and had to settle for Noto Sans as a replacement

Paragraphs: [Ubunto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono)

### Single Page and UX Design Decisions and Why.
Here are some of the decisions why I choose a single page design over multiple pages:
1. The quantity of content did not require multiple pages. Perhaps when I decide to add more content onto my website, I may reconsider and have multiple pages
2. Tells a better story - with the user scrolling top to bottom, they find out information about me, and then decide whether to contact or connect with me at the end of the page
3. Provides the information the user needs to know about me with one page
4. Its intuitive, and user will not get lost in the website having to go from page to page 
5. The navigational bar at the top of the mobile design did not have a hamburger menu bar because of the single page design, and the nav bar only containing four buttons to click. If I decided to add more content/pages to the website, I may reconsider condensing the navigational pane to a menu bar.
6. The CV, and links to LinkedIn, github, etc, open a new tab instead of loading the existing tab. This allows the user to still refer back to my website, rather than having to click on the back button on their browser

## Tools

### [Form Spree](https://formspree.io/ "Form Spree Website")
As the HTML form does not allow browsers to route the form submission to an inbox, this tool was used as the 'middle man' of sending messages from my HTML page to my inbox which was easy to implement.

## The Final Product

I'm happy with the final product with the level of content and languages that I've learnt so far. However, the level of content on this page is quite minimal, and the layout will likely change once I have more content (or skills/experience). The one change I would make is being able to do smooth scrolling when clicking on links in navigational bar, so it is obviously to the user that they're looking a single page website - however after reading a few articles, it appears to require knowledge of JS or JQuery, which I currently do not have just yet. I'll likely implement this once I've had the time to learn this.
