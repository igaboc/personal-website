# Personal Website Portfolio [https://isabellegaboc.netlify.com/]

The aim of this project was to create a personal website, that provides information about who I am, my skills, my resume, and how to contact me. Using the appropriate coding languages learnt (so far) from my intensive course (HTML and CSS), I have been able to create a website that will showcase the MVP for this project.

## The Minimum Viable Product

* Responsive website viewable on small, and medium/desktop devices
* Contain information about me, my skills, my projects and how to contact me
* Functional links to access my resume, and how to connect with me
* Create a contact me form that will send me an email notification when a user has submitted this form
* An appropriate UX design that will enable professionals to intuitively navigate through the website
